# LUI - Less UI
LUI or "Less UI" is front-end framework made to make your coding easier. If you dont need all the stuff around you can just use our grid and mixins. Other UI stuff like forms/tables will be as "extra" package in the future

**How to use**
```less
@import "/path/to/lui/less/router.less"; // lui

@import "/path/to/project-styles/config.less"; // project settings
@import "/path/to/project-styles/theme.less"; // project styles
```


**Awesome grid system**
- able to set both vertical and horizontal position of columns (!!!)
- more resolutions, but if you dont need responsive, you can simply use static grid (!)
- extra columns size for print (!!)
- need 5, 7, 8, 9, 10 or 11 columns in grid? no problem!
- **flexbox FTW**

**UI stuff:**
- Responsive forms
- Responsive table
- Mobile friendly pagebar
- FontAwesome!
- Some buttons - also mobile friendly if you need
