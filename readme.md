# LUI - Less UI
LUI or "Less UI" is front-end framework made to make your coding easier. If you dont need all the stuff around you can just use our grid and mixins. Other UI stuff like forms/tables will be as "extra" package in the future

**DISCONTINUED - only bug fixes will be released**

LUI-3 - completely modular framework is now in making: https://github.com/LUI-3

**How to use**
```less

```


**Awesome grid system**
- able to set both vertical and horizontal position of columns (!!!)
- more resolutions, but if you dont need responsive, you can simply use static grid (!)
- extra columns size for print (!!)
- need 5, 7, 8, 9, 10 or 11 columns in grid? no problem!
- **flexbox FTW**

**UI stuff:**
- Responsive forms
- Responsive table
- Mobile friendly pagebar
